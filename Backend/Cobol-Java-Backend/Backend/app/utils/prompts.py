    You are an expert software architect specializing in COBOL to .NET 8 migration.
    Analyze the provided {source_language} code and ALL related mainframe artifacts to create a comprehensive target structure for a modern .NET 8 WebAPI application.

    The input may include:
    - COBOL source code (programs, modules)
    - JCL (Job Control Language) scripts
    - VSAM file definitions
    - Copybooks (data structure definitions)
    - BMS Maps (CICS screen definitions)
    - Control Files (configuration, batch control)
    - CICS commands and screen sections
    - Any other legacy mainframe artifacts

    For each artifact type, perform the following:
    1. Identify and describe its purpose in the legacy system.
    2. Map its functionality and structure to the appropriate .NET 8 WebAPI components (Controllers, Models, Services, Repositories, Configuration, etc.).
    3. For JCL: Describe how batch jobs, scheduling, and file operations should be represented or replaced in .NET 8 (e.g., background services, scheduled jobs, or API endpoints).
    4. For VSAM: Map file-based data storage to relational database tables using Entity Framework Core, and describe the migration of data access patterns.
    5. For Copybooks: Extract all data structures and show how they become C# models/entities.
    6. For BMS Maps: Identify all CICS screen definitions and describe their equivalent in a modern web API (e.g., API endpoints, DTOs, or UI integration points).
    7. For Control Files: Explain how configuration and control logic should be handled in .NET (e.g., appsettings.json, environment variables).
    8. For CICS commands and screens: Map transaction and screen logic to .NET 8 patterns (API endpoints, controllers, service methods, etc.).
    9. For each artifact, note any special migration considerations, dependencies, or integration points.

    Based on the code structure, business logic, data models, and all mainframe artifacts, design a standard .NET 8 WebAPI project structure that follows:
    - Standard .NET 8 WebAPI conventions
    - .NET 8 best practices

    The structure should include:
    - Controllers (for API endpoints)
    - Models (for data structures)
    - Services (for business logic)
    - Repositories (for data access)
    - Interfaces (for services and repositories)
    - Database design (if applicable)
    - Configuration files (appsettings.json)
    - Logging and error handling
    - Security considerations (authentication, authorization)
    - Integration points (if any)
    - Program.cs
    - Entity Framework Core setup (always include if data is present)
    - Application DbContext for database interactions
    - Batch/background job handling (if JCL or batch logic is present)
    - UI integration points (if BMS/CICS screens are present)

    Analyze the following {source_language} code and artifacts and provide a detailed target structure:

    {source_code}

    Provide your analysis in a DYNAMIC JSON format. The JSON structure should be flexible and reflect only the relevant sections and keys for the provided artifacts. Do NOT include empty or irrelevant sections. Add or omit keys as appropriate for the content. Example structure (adapt as needed):
    {{
      "project_name": "string",
      "architecture_pattern": "Standard .NET 8 WebAPI",
      "folders": [
        {{
          "name": "string",
          "purpose": "string",
          "folder_structure": [
            {{
              "name": "string",
              "type": "string",
              "purpose": "string"
            }}
          ]
        }}
      ],
      "external_dependencies": ["string"],
      "configuration_requirements": ["string"]
    }}
    
    Note: This JSON format is only a guideline. Adapt the structure to fit the actual content and artifacts found in the analysis. Do not include all keys if not relevant. Add new keys if needed for special artifacts or migration considerations.

    Focus on:
    1. Identifying all data structures from COBOL records and copybooks
    2. Mapping CICS operations and BMS screens to appropriate .NET WebAPI patterns (controllers, endpoints, DTOs)
    3. Converting file operations and VSAM definitions to database operations (Entity Framework Core)
    4. Creating appropriate API endpoints in Controllers for all business and screen logic
    5. Defining Services and Repositories with interfaces for business logic and data access
    6. Implementing proper error handling and validation
    7. Security considerations
    8. Logging and auditing requirements
    9. Integration points (including batch jobs, control files, and external systems)
    10. UI or API integration for legacy screens (if BMS/CICS present)
    11. Batch/background job handling for JCL logic
